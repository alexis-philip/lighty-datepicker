# Raw HTML & CSS

These files are examples of what the library will append to the DOM.

Since you do not need to append HTML yourself, I am providing these files to show
raw HTML structure of the datepicker, as well as the raw CSS.

## index.html

This file contains the HTML which will be appended automatically by the library.

## style.css

This file contains the CSS which will be appended automatically by the library.
